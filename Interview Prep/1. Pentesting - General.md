# Methodology
## 1. Reconnaisance
- Passive:
	- Whois
	- DNS enumeration
	- Tech stack profiling
- Active
	- Nmap scan
		- Open ports, technologies used, OS
	- Subdomain/vhost fuzzing
		- dirbuster, gobuster
	- nc for banner grabbing

## 2. Enumeration
- Start deeper probing of each discovered service
- eg. SMB found
	- nmap with --scrip=smb*
	- anonymous login
	- share enumeration
	- bruteforcce credentials
	- check version of SMB, see if EternalBlue applies
	- LLMNR+ Responder (if internal)

## 3. Exploitation
- Take a vulnerablity found during enumeration, try to leverage it to gain unauthorised behaviour
### WEB
- Manual payload crafting
- Burp Suite repeater/intruder
- SQL injection → UNION, boolean-based, time-based
- SSTI → `{{ 7*7 }}`
- File upload → bypass extension filters
- SSRF → access internal metadata service
- Command injection → `;id`

### INFRASTRUCTURE
- SMB → attempt null session or valid credentials
- RDP → credential brute force (safe rate-limited)
- Misconfigured services → weak permissions

### ACTIVE DIRECTORY
- Kerberoasting → request service tickets
- AS-REP roast → users without pre-auth
- Password spraying → slow and controlled
## 4. Privilege Escalation
### LINUX CHECKLIST
- Who am I?
- What groups am I in?
- SUID binaries (`find / -perm -4000 -type f`)
- Sudo permissions (`sudo -l`)
- Cron jobs running as root
- Writable files executed by root
- Capabilities (e.g., `cap_setuid`)
- Kernel version (avoid exploiting in enterprise)
- Interesting files (`/etc/passwd`, backups)

### WINDOWS CHECKLIST
- Who am I? (`whoami /priv`)
- Local group membership
- Service misconfigurations
- Unquoted service paths
- DLL hijacking possibilities
- Registry permissions
- Stored credentials (`cmdkey`, WinSCP, Putty`)
- Token impersonation
- UAC bypass opportunities
- Installed software versions

### ACTIVE DIRECTORY CHECKLIST
- Kerberoastable users
- AS-REP roastable users
- Weak ACLs
- Group memberships
- GPP password
- Credential leakage
- LAPS misconfigurations
