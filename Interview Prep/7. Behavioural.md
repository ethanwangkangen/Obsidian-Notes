## Myself, why cybersec
- Year 3 Computer Science student specialising in cyber security. 
- Took an interest to the red team side of cybersec, am currently pursuing OSCP and plan to take it mid next year
- Enjoy cybersecurity because of the investigative and problem solving aspects. I love to understand how attacks happen and how to prevent them.

## Why KPMG
- Advisory and consulting - give me the chance to work with and learn from experienced professionals in the field of cybersec and pentesting, who are in charge of the security of large clients where the work truly matters
- KPMG one of the big 4 accounting firms - it seems like a company where I have the opportunity to learn a lot and grow, especially as someone who's just starting a career, important to me to find a place where I can develop my skills and learn from more experienced people in this field

## Why this role
- Aligns very well with my interests and what I hope to achieve from it.
- More interested in the red team side of cybersec, studying for OSCP. 
- Would rather do a role like this than something like GRC or SOC

## Goals for internship

- If perform well, hope to possible get a return offer as well

## Time I had to learn something quickly
