## Tools
dnsenum
- dns record enumeration
- zone transfer attempts
- subdomain brute forcing
- google scraping
- reverse lookup
- whois lookups
- `dnsenum --enum inlanefreight.com -f /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-20000.txt -r`
	- -r: recursive brute forcing
	- 

## Zone transfer
- Copy of all DNS records within a zone from one name server to another
- `dig axfr @nsztm1.digi.ninja zonetransfer.me
	- Request a one transfer from nsztm1.di.ninja for tthe zonetransfer.me domain

# Certificate Transparency Logs
- Public, append-only ledgers that record issuance of SSL/TLS certificates
- Global registry of certifcates
- Provide definitive record of certificates issued for a domain and its subdomain

Searching CT logs
- crt.sh
	- `curl -s "https://crt.sh/?q=facebook.com&output=json" | jq -r '.[] | select(.name_value | contains("dev")) | .name_value' | sort -u
		- fetches JSON output from crt.sh for erts matching domain facebook.com
		- jq .. -> filters for entries where name_value field (contianing domain/subdomain) includes the string 'dev'
		- sort -u: sorts alphabetically and removes duplicates

- Censys

# Fingerprinting
- Banner grabbing
	- curl the url
- Analysing HTTP headers
	- Server header typically discloses web server software, X-Powered-By header might reveal additional technologies like scripting languages or frameworks
- Probing for specific responses
- Analysing page content
