Neetcode
- contains duplicates
	- learned about unordered_set (hashmap)
- valid anagram
	- learned about unordered_map, and how to iterate through it
- two sum
	- read question carefully!
- group anagrams (halfway through)
	- learned about references in c++, and the difference between this and pointer(halfway done, refer to chatgpt)

- continued group anagrams
	- learned about map vs unordered map
		- unordered map requires hash function which `vector<int>` doesnt have
		- map only requires `>` operator, which `vector<int>` does have
- To do:
	- Revise min/max heap data structure
	- Review past problems -> syntax, think about time complexity
	- When doing problems
		- Think about the algorithmic solution first
		- Come up with the time and memory complexity
			- (Will also require knowledge on choice of data structure)
		- Only then, think about implementation
		- Try to find a better solution, or better technical implementation (eg. using array instead of vector)
		- Time complexities (performance) of map vs unordered map
