Protocol that resolves domain names to Ip addresses.

Full DNS Resolution process:
- Check Local DNS Cache (stored in OS or browser cche)
- Ask the OS-configured DNS resolver 
	- OS sends query to configured DNS resolver (usually ISP's or public one like 8.8.8.8)
		- this is what is in /etc/resolv.conf
- Recursive Resolution begins
	- a. root server
		- 13 main root servers globally, respond with IP of the TLD server (eg. .com nameserver)
	- b. TLD server (top level domain)
		- returns the IP of the authoritative nameserver for google.come
	- c. authoritative DNS server
		- returns the actual A record (IP address) of google.com

| **Record Type** | **Meaning**                       | **Example**                                |
| --------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| A               | Maps domain to IPv4               | `google.com → 142.250.190.36`              |
| AAAA            | Maps to IPv6                      | `google.com → 2607:f8b0:4005:...`          |
| CNAME           | Canonical name (alias)            | `www.example.com → example.com`            |
| MX              | Mail Exchange                     | `example.com → mail1.example.com`          |
| NS              | Name Servers                      | `example.com → ns1.dnsprovider.com`        |
| TXT             | Misc. text data (e.g., SPF, DKIM) | Used in email security                     |
| PTR             | Reverse lookup (IP → domain)      | `36.190.250.142.in-addr.arpa → google.com` |
| SOA             | Start of Authority                | Info about a DNS zone                      |


DNS usually unencrypted
- over port 53
- anyone on network path (ISP, wifi hotspot etc.) can see which domains are queried, and potentially modify or block the response


Options for encrypting DNS:

| Protocol                 | Transport   | Port | Description                                                      |
| ------------------------ | ----------- | ---- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **DNS over HTTPS (DoH)** | HTTPS (TCP) | 443  | DNS queries are sent as HTTPS requests (just like browsing).     |
| **DNS over TLS (DoT)**   | TLS (TCP)   | 853  | Encrypted version of DNS using its own port.                     |
| **DoQ (DNS over QUIC)**  | QUIC (UDP)  | 8853 | Fast, encrypted DNS using QUIC. Newer and less widely supported. |


# Relevant Commands

dig
- dig google.com
- to see A record,
	- dig google.com ANY (IPv4 address)
- to see full recursive resolution
	- dig +trace google.com

nslookup
- nslookup google.com

host
- host google.com


cat /etc/resolv.conf
- see which dns servers system is using
- nameserver = DNS resolver
	- if see 127.0.0.53, this is actually pointing to local stub resolver
	- this means that the local DNS client (a stub resolver) is listening on 127.0.0.53, is part of systemd-resolved.
	- when app asks for example.com, is calls the OS stub resolver, which sends the request to 127.0.0.53. 
	- systemd-resolved receives it and checks its configured upstream DNS servers
	- then contacts a real DNS resolver (eg. 1.1.1.1) on your behalf
	- receives result and passes it back to app

systemd-resolve / resolvectl
- resolvectl query www.google.com
- resolvectl status -> to see the actual DNS resolvers being used

tcpdump for DNS
- capture DNS traffic for port 53
- sudo tcpdump -i any port 53
