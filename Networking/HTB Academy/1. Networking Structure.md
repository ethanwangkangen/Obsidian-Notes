# Network Types
- WAN
	- Wide Area Network
	- The internet
	- Made up of LANs joined together
- LAN
	- Local Area Network
- VPN
	- Site-to-site vpn
		- Both client and servers are Network Devices, typically routers/firewalls
		- Used to join company networks over internet
	- Remote Access vpn
		- Client creates virtual interface that behaves as if it is on client's network
	- SSL vpn
		- Done within web browser

# Proxies
- Dedicated/Forward proxy
	- Filters **OUTGOING** requests
	- Barrier between host and internet
	- Defend against malware, malware needs to be proxy aware
		- eg. Blocks delivery, stops data theft..
	- eg. Burp Suite
	- Typical controls on modern forward proxy
		- TLS inspection (MITM) with enterprise root CA to see inside HTTPS
		- URL/domain reputation & categories, custom blocklists/allowlists.
		- File controls: block executables/scripts, inspect archives, size/type limits, sandbox detonations.
		- Remote Browser Isolation (RBI) for risky categories.
		- DNS control (if the proxy also handles DNS or forces DoT/DoH through it); sinkhole known bads.
		- Rate/behaviour rules: detect beacon intervals, unusual hostnames, or user-agent anomalies.
- Reverse proxy
	- Filters **INCOMING** requests
	- eg. Cloudfare
		- Used by webserver to filter amount and type of traffic incoming, to prevent DDOS etc.
	- Common goal: listen on that address and forward it to a closed off network
		- eg. Pentesting (malicious)
		- Attacker configure reverse proxy on infected endpoint
		- The infected endpoint listens on port and sends any client that connects to it back to the attacker
			- Essentially, infected endpoint acts as a gateway to other machines
		- Can bypass firewalls, evade logging
		- Organisations may have Intrusion Detection System, watching external web requests
			- If attacker gains access to organisation over SSH, reverse proxy can send web requests through SSH tunnel and evade IDS
	- Prevent such attacks:
		- Look for one device keeping very long HTTPS sessions to a rare domain and, at the same times, making new internal connections.
		- Treat unusual CONNECT usage, regular beacon timing, and QUIC/DoH attempts as high-signal leads.
