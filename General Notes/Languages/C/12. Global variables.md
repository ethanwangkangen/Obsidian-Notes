```c
// Global variable -> declared outside a function
const uint32_t someGlobalValue = 0x12345678;  // example value
// If want to be able to modify this variable, don't include const

// Extern variable
If the variable is defined in one file but accessed in others, it might be declared as:

// In a header file or other source files
extern uint32_t someGlobalValue;

```

Noticed that in a decompiled piece of code, variable was modified by a funcition without having to pass any pointer to the function.
- Variable was likely a global variable, defined outside of any function scope.
