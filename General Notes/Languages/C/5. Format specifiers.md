- `%d`: Reads a signed integer.
- `%f`: Reads a floating-point number (e.g., `float`).
- `%lf`: Reads a double-precision floating-point number (e.g., `double`).
- `%c`: Reads a single character.
- `%s`: Reads a string of non-whitespace characters. **Crucially, it stops reading at the first whitespace character (space, tab, newline).** It automatically appends a null terminator (`\0`) to the end of the string.
- `%x` or `%X`: Reads a hexadecimal integer.
- `%o`: Reads an octal integer.

# Width specifiers
- eg. in scanf, when using %s for strings, scanf doesn't know the size of the buffer provided.
	- When user types more characters than buffer can hold, leads to buffer overflow, overwriting adjacent memory
	- Mitigation: use width specifier
		- `scanf("%99s", buffer);`
		- ie. read at most 99 characters, for buffer of size 100 (1 for null terminator)
