Arrays are a type of variable that store a collection of items.

```c
int intArr[6];
```

Assuming this is within a function,
- A section of memory is reserved in the stack, with size
	- 6 * sizeof(int)
- The address of the starting element is returned, and intArr now stores that

Array indexing is just syntactic sugar for pointer arithmetic

Decaying of arrays
```c
char str[] = "hello";

// This is treated as (for most contexts)
(char *) &str[0]; // So str becomes a char * pointing to 'h'
```
