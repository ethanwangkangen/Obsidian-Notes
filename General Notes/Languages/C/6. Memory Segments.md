What is stored in static segment (BSS and Initialised Data)
- global variables
	- eg. int globalVar = 42; // outside of all functions, even main()
- static variables
	- static int b = 10;
- BSS if unitialised.

What is **static** in C?
- static variable within a function - *local static variable*
	- this variable is initialised only once (on first function call) and retains value between function calls
	- stored in **data segment**, not the stak
- static at global scope - *file level visibility*
	- variable only visible within the same source file
	- internal linkage, so can't be accessed from other .c files during linking
	- hide global variables from other parts of program
- static functions - *file level visibility
	- function can only be called within this source file
	- other .c files cannot see or link to this function
	- useful for encapsulation (like *private* method in other language)
