`int main (int arg c, char *argv[]){`
`}`

- arg c
	- number of variables passed into main]
- char \*argv
	- argv is an array that stores (char \*), or char pointers. Each pointing to a null-terminated string.
	- can also write as char \*\*argv

## strings in c
- There are different implementations of string.
	- char pointer
		- char \*str
	- char buffer
		- char str\[] 
	- but the char buffer will be degenerate char pointer.
- eg.
	- "apple" stored as \['a', 'p', 'p', 'l', 'e', '\0'] # Remember they are null terminated

| Address | Content |     |
| ------- | ------- | --- |
| 0x1000  | 'a'     |     |
| 0x1001  | 'p'     |     |
| ..      | ..      |     |

Then, char \*string1 stores 0x1000, which is the address of the first char in the string.
- Remember that when we write char \*string1, we mean that string1 is of type char\*.
	- Note that this usually stores the string in **read-only memory**
- ie, string1 stores the address of a char.
- can also write as char str1\[]. **Do this is you want to modify it.
