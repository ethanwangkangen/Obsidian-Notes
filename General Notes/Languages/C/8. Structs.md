User-defined data type.
But no OOP! Different from Objects in OOp languages in this regard. No encapsulation, inheritance or polymorphism.

```c
struct StructName {
    type member1;
    type member2;
    ...
};
```

Accessing struct members
```c
struct Point p1;
p1.x = 3;
p1.y = 4;


// If have a pointer to a struct, use the arrow.
struct Point* ptr = &p1;
printf("%d", ptr->x);  // same as (*ptr).x
```

Initialising Structs
```c
struct Point p1 = {3, 4};         // positional
struct Point p2 = {.y = 5, .x = 1}; // named initialisation (C99+)
```

Typedef
```c
typedef struct {
    int x, y;
} Point;

Point p1;  // no need to write "struct Point" anymore

```

Can also have nested structs.
