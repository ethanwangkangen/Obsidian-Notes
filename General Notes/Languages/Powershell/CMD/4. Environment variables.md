# Environment variables
- System vs User scope
	- User = local per user
		- eg. Alice does `set SECRET = ...`
	- System
		- eg. `echo %WINDIR`
	- Process 
		- stored in process memory

| Scope              | Description                                                                  | Permissions Required to Access                                    | Registry Location                                                                 |

| `System (Machine)` | Environment variales defined by OS, accessible by **all** users and accounts | Local Administrator or Domain Administrator                       | `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Environment` |
| `User`             | Defined by **active user**, only accessible to active user                   | Current Active User, Local Administrator, or Domain Administrator | `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Environment`                                                   |
| `Process`          | Defined and accessible in the context of **currently running process**       | Current Child Process, Parent Process, or Current Active User     | `None (Stored in Process Memory)`                                                 |

# Variable commands
## set
- `set`
	- to print all envir variables
- `set %VARIABLENAME%`
	- to see %variablename's value
- `set DCIP=172.16.5.2`
	- to set variable value
- Only manipulates environment variables in current command line session
	- May not be reflected when we open a command prompt the next time

## echo
- to see environment variable value
	- `echo %PATH%`

## setx
- `setx DCIP 172.16.5.2`
	- Note: no need = anymore
- IMPORTANT: saves value to registry.
- `setx DCIP ""`
	- Remove the value

# Important Environment Variables
| Variable Name         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `%PATH%`              | Specifies a set of **directories**(locations) where executable programs are located.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `%OS%`                | The current **operating system** on the user's workstation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `%SYSTEMROOT%`        | Expands to `C:\Windows`. A system-defined read-only variable **containing the Windows system folder**. Anything Windows considers important to its core functionality is found here, including important data, core system binaries, and configuration files.                                 |
| `%LOGONSERVER%`       | Provides us with the login **server** for the currently active user **followed by the machine's hostname**. We can use this information to know if a machine is joined to a domain or workgroup.                                                                                              |

| `%ProgramFiles%`      | Equivalent of **`C:\Program Files`**. This location is where all the programs are installed on an `x64` based system.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `%ProgramFiles(x86)%` | Equivalent of **`C:\Program Files (x86)`**. This location is where all 32-bit programs running under `WOW64` are installed. Note that this variable is only accessible on a 64-bit host. It can be used to indicate what kind of host we are interacting with. (`x86` vs. `x64` architecture) |
