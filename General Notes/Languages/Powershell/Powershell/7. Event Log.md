| System Log       | The system log contains events related to the **Windows** **system** and its components. A system-level event could be a **service failing at startup**.                                                                    |
| Security Log     | Self-explanatory; these include **security**-related events such as **failed and successful logins,** and file creation/deletion. These can be used to detect various types of attacks that we will cover in later modules. |
| Application Log  | This stores events related to any software/**application** installed on the system. For example, if Slack has trouble starting it will be recorded in this log.                                                             |
| Setup Log        | This log holds any events that are generated when the **Windows** operating system is **installed**. In a domain environment, events related to Active Directory will be recorded in this log on domain controller hosts.   |
| Forwarded Events | Logs that are **forwarded** from other hosts within the same network.                                                                                                                                                       |
