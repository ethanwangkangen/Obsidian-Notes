# Local vs Domain Joined users
- Domain users - granted rights from domain to access resources like file servers, etc. based on user and group membership
	- Can log in to **any** host in the domain

# User Groups
- Way to sort user accounts logically
- `Get-LocalGroup`
	- Get groups on host
- `Get-LocalGroupMember -name "users"
	- Get users in specific group
- `Add-LocalGroupMember -Group "Remote Desktop Users" -Member "JLawrence"`
	- Add a user to group
- `Get-localuser`
	- Identify current 
- `New-LocalUser -Name "ethan" -NoPassword`
	- Create new user
- `Set-LocalUser -Name "ethan" -Password $Password`
	- Set password with `$Password = Read-Host -AsSecureString *****`
	- Modify user
