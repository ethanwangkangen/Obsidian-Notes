| **Feature**         | **CMD**                                             | **PowerShell**                                                                    |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Language            | Batch and basic CMD commands only.                  | PowerShell can interpret Batch, CMD, PS cmdlets, and aliases.                     |
| Command utilization | Cannot do that                                      | Can pass output from one command into another directly as a structured **object** |
| Command Output      | Text only.                                          | PowerShell outputs in object formatting.                                          |
| Parallel Execution  | CMD must finish one command before running another. | PowerShell can multi-thread commands to run in parallel.                          |

## Aside: Shell VS Terminal
- Shell is a program that interprets commands you type
	- eg. bash, zsh, fish -> Linux
	- eg. cmd.exe, powershell.exe -> Windows
	- When you type ls, the shell runs /bin/ls for you
- Terminal emulator
	- A window/program that lets you **interact** with the **shell**
		- eg. GNOME terminal, Windows Terminal

# How to access PowerShell
- PowerShell app
- Windows Terminal
	- Terminal Emulator, able to access multiple different CLI through a single app
- Windows Powershell Integrated Scripting Environment (ISE)
	- Like IDE for PowerShell
- PowerShell in CMD
	- Type powershell.exe in CMD

# Basics
cmddlets are in verb-noun format

- `Get-Help <cmdlet>`
	- To get info on cmdlet
	- `Update-Help` to make sure have most update info
- `Get-Location`
	- Alias is `pwd` (and that's what it does)
- `Get-ChildItem
	- Aliases: `ls`, `dir`
- `Set-Location`
	- Alias: `cd`
- `Get-Content`
	- Alias: `cat`, `type`

## Get-command
- `Get-command`
	- List all cmdlets
- `Get-command -verb get`
	- List all cmdlsets that start with get*
	- Can also do `Get-command get*`
- `Get-command -noun windows*`
- `Get-command -Module PowerShellGet

## History
- History stored in 2 ways
	- Built-in session history: implemented and deleted at start and end of each console session
		- `Get-History`
	- PSReadLine module: tracks history of all PS commands across all sessions 
		- `Get-Content C:\Users\DLarusso\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\PSReadLine\ConsoleHost_history.txt`
		- Note: this one will filter entries that include the strings: password, asplaintext, token, apikey, secret
			- The built-in session does not do this

## Clear screen
- `Clear-Host`

## Hotkeys
| **HotKey**         | **Description**                                                                                                         |

| `CTRL+R`           | It makes for a searchable history. We can start typing after, and it will show us results that match previous commands. |
| `CTRL+L`           | Quick screen clear.                                                                                                     |
| `CTRL+ALT+Shift+?` | This will print the entire list of keyboard shortcuts PowerShell will recognize.                                        |
| `Escape`           | Clears entire line                                                                                                      |
| `↑`                | Scroll up through our previous history.                                                                                 |
| `↓`                | Scroll down through our previous history.                                                                               |
| `F7`               | Brings up a TUI with a scrollable interactive history from our session.                                                 |
