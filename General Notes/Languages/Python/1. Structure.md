# A sensible learning path (security-optimised)
1. **Core plumbing:** `argparse`, `logging`, `requests`, `subprocess` , `pathlib`
    → Build small, robust tools and wrappers around nmap/ffuf/zap-cli.
2. **Concurrency:** `ThreadPoolExecutor`, `asyncio` + `httpx`  
    → Scale directory/API enumeration responsibly.    
3. **Networking bones:** `socket`, `ssl`, `struct`, `ipaddress`  
    → Diagnose weird services, craft minimal protocol checks, banner grabs.
4. **Protocols:** `scapy`, `impacket`, `paramiko`, `dnspython`  
    → Real value in internal assessments and AD-adjacent tasks.
5. **Crypto (practical):** `cryptography` for safe modes, `pycryptodome` for labs.
6. **Polish & safety:** `rich`, `typer`, `pydantic`, `tenacity`, YAML/JSON outputs.


## Phase 1 — Core plumbing (2–3 days)

**Goal:** Make small scripts behave like trustworthy tools (CLI, logging, safe defaults).

**Why first:** You’ll use argparse, logging and requests/subprocess in almost every tool you write.

**What to learn**

- `argparse` (required): positional vs optional, `nargs`, `action` (`store_true`, `count`, `append`), subcommands, custom `type`, `FileType`, pre-parsing config.
- `logging` (required): logger vs root, handlers, formatters, rotating logs, redaction patterns.
- `requests` basics (required): Session, timeouts, proxies, verify, headers, streaming.
- `subprocess` basics (required): `run` vs `Popen`, safe arg lists, capture_output, streaming stdout/stderr, timeouts, avoid `shell=True`.
- `pathlib`, `tempfile` (required): file management.
    
**Deliverables**

- A CLI HTTP probe tool (from earlier) with:
    - `--hosts`, `--ports` (nargs), `--proxy`, `--timeout`, `-v` verbosity.
    - JSON output and rotated log file (redact cookies/auth headers).
    - Wrap `requests` calls with timeouts and retries (basic).
- A safe subprocess wrapper to run `nmap` and capture output.
    

**Exercises**

1. Build `probe.py` with `argparse`, `logging`, `requests`.
2. Test `probe.py` with `--proxy` to a local intercepting proxy (simulate by passing an invalid proxy and catch error).
3. Wrap an `nmap` call with `subprocess.run` and print first 30 lines of stdout.
    

**Libraries**
- Required: `requests`
- Optional helpers: `tenacity` for retries (you’ll add later).

## Phase 2 — Concurrency & I/O scaling (3–4 days)

**Goal:** Make tools fast and scalable for network-heavy tasks.

**Why:** Port scanning, directory fuzzing, API enumeration — all benefit from concurrency.

**What to learn**

- `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` and `ProcessPoolExecutor`: easy, practical patterns.
- `asyncio` basics: event loop, `async def`, `await`, cancellation.
- `httpx` or `aiohttp` for async HTTP clients.
- Thread-safety issues (shared state, queues).
- Rate-limiting and back-pressure patterns (lee-way, `asyncio.Semaphore`, `sleep` jitter).
    

**Deliverables**
- Two versions of a directory discovery tool:
    - Threaded (ThreadPoolExecutor) `ffuf`-style with `requests.Session`.
    - Async (httpx.AsyncClient) with semaphores and concurrency control.
- A reusable concurrency utility function (worker pool + queue + graceful shutdown).
    

**Exercises**
1. Implement a ThreadPool port scanner: `scan(host, ports, max_workers)`.
2. Implement an async directory fuzzer that honours a `--rate` (requests/sec) limit.
3. Replace naive `.append()` shared list with `queue.Queue` and observe thread-safety.
    

**Libraries**
- Required: `httpx` (async) or `aiohttp`
- Useful: `asyncio`, `concurrent.futures`

## Phase 3 — Networking bones (3–5 days)

**Goal:** Understand low-level sockets, TLS wrapping, binary framing and `struct`.

**Why:** When a subtle banner or custom TCP/UDP frame reveals a vuln, you need to craft bytes precisely.

**What to learn**

- `socket.create_connection`, `socket.socket`, timeouts, `SO_REUSEADDR`.
- `ssl.create_default_context()` and `wrap_socket()` for SNI, cert inspection.
- `struct.pack`/`unpack` for binary protocol fields (endianness `!` vs `<`/`>`).
- `ipaddress` for CIDR manipulation.
- `select` / `selectors` basics (non-blocking multiplexing optional).
    

**Deliverables**

- Banner grabber that can:
    - do plain TCP and TLS (SNI),
    - return server cert details (subject, SANs),
    - and optionally parse a basic protocol header using `struct`.
        
- A reusable function to iterate IPs from CIDR for scanner input.
    

**Exercises**

1. Write `banner(host, port, timeout) -> bytes` that supports TLS via a flag.
2. Parse a small header: e.g., given `!HHI` read two 16-bit and one 32-bit ints from a byte stream.
3. Write a small script that checks TLS cert expiry (parse cert, print days left).
    

**Libraries**
- Standard lib: `socket`, `ssl`, `struct`, `ipaddress`, `selectors`.
- Optional: `cryptography` for nicer X.509 parsing (Phase 8).
    

---

## Phase 4 — HTTP / Web tooling & parsing (3–5 days)

**Goal:** Master web flows: sessions, CSRF, forms, JS-heavy sites (basic).

**Why:** Most modern assessments are web-application heavy.

**What to learn**

- `requests.Session` patterns: cookie jars, headers, auth sequences.
- HTML parsing: `beautifulsoup4` / `lxml`.
- Form extraction and CSRF handling; parsing JS pages minimally.
- Automation: `playwright` (or `selenium`) only if needed for JS rendering.
- URL handling & encoding: `urllib.parse` (`quote`, `urljoin`, `parse_qs`).
- `websockets` for WS endpoints basic use.
    

**Deliverables**

- A session-based login & replay tool: perform login, save cookies, replay requests.
- A page parser that extracts forms (fields, action, method) and builds POST bodies.
    

**Exercises**

1. Write `login_and_fetch(url, username, password)` that logs in and fetches a protected page.
2. Given a raw HTML page, extract all forms and return `{action, method, inputs}`.
    

**Libraries**

- Required: `beautifulsoup4`, `lxml`
- Optional: `playwright` (install only when needed)

## Phase 5 — Protocol tooling & offensive libraries (4–7 days)

**Goal:** Learn tooling for AD/SMB/SSH and packet-level work.

**Why:** For Windows/AD pentests and low-level network tests.

**What to learn**

- `scapy` basics: sending/receiving crafted packets, ARP spoofing PoC (ethical scope only).
- `impacket`: SMB, NTLM, Kerberos operations (listing shares, DCE/RPC).
- `paramiko`: SSH sessions, key-based auth, SFTP scripting.
- `dnspython`: DNS queries, zone transfer checks (AXFR).
- PCAP parsing: `pyshark` or reading via `scapy`.
    

**Deliverables**

- SMB share lister using `impacket`.
- A small `paramiko` script to execute a command on a list of hosts (gracefully handle auth errors).
- A `scapy` script that crafts a custom UDP probe and reads response.
    

**Exercises**

1. List SMB shares of a host and save results to JSON.
2. Use `paramiko` to upload and execute a single-line script remotely (simulate authorised admin tool).
    

**Libraries**

- Required (for Windows/AD work): `impacket`, `paramiko`, `scapy`, `dnspython`
- Note: these often require system deps (capabilities) — set up in venv + system packages.
    

---

## Phase 6 — Data formats, configs & secrets (1–2 days)

**Goal:** Use stable config patterns so tools are repeatable & secure.

**What to learn**

- JSON, YAML/TOML for config; `python-dotenv` for secrets.
- `pydantic` for config validation (optional but useful).
- Config merging precedence: CLI > env > config file > defaults.
- Secrets practices: `.env`, env vars, never commit secrets.
    

**Deliverables**

- CLI tool that accepts `--config config.yml` and merges properly.
- Example `config.yml` and `.env` for credentials (gitignored).
    

**Exercises**

1. Implement pre-parse for `--config` and merge values afterward.
2. Validate config using minimal `pydantic` model.
    

**Libraries**

- `PyYAML`, `python-dotenv`, `pydantic` (optional)
    

---

## Phase 7 — Subprocess + tool integration (2–3 days)

**Goal:** Safely wrap CLI tools and parse outputs.

**Why:** Many pentest tasks are glue-work around `nmap`, `ffuf`, `gobuster`, `msfconsole`.

**What to learn**

- `subprocess.run` with list args, `capture_output`, `timeout`.
- `Popen` for streaming output & incremental parsing.
- Parse outputs (XML from `nmap -oX`, JSON output where possible).
- Avoid `shell=True` unless necessary. Use `shlex.split()` when building commands.
    

**Deliverables**

- A wrapper for `nmap` that runs a scan and saves parsed results to JSON (using `-oX` then parse with `xml.etree` or `libnmap` if you want).
- A streaming wrapper for `tcpdump` that processes lines in near-realtime.
    

**Exercises**

1. Run `nmap -oX - ...` and extract open ports from the XML stdout.
    
2. Implement a `run_streaming(cmd)` that yields lines as the subprocess prints them.
    

**Libraries**

- `shlex`, `subprocess`, optional parsing libs (lxml or xml.etree).
    

---

## Phase 8 — Crypto fundamentals (practical) (2–4 days)

**Goal:** Understand common crypto primitives and how to use libraries correctly.

**Why:** You’ll inspect schemes, detect misuse (ECB, no IV), and sometimes craft simple exploits for labs.

**What to learn**

- `cryptography` high-level APIs (AES-GCM, RSA signatures, X.509).
- `pycryptodome` for number theory/CTF tasks (factorisation tools, RSA math).
- Hashes & HMAC (`hashlib`, `hmac`).
- Safe key handling and use of AEAD modes.
    

**Deliverables**

- Small util to decrypt/encrypt file with AES-GCM given password using HKDF for keys.
- X.509 inspector printing cert subject/SANs and expiry.
    

**Exercises**

1. Given ciphertext + nonce + key, decrypt with AES-GCM using `cryptography`.
2. Implement a check that flags use of AES in ECB mode in sample code.
    

**Libraries**

- `cryptography`, `pycryptodome`
    

---

## Phase 9 — Robustness, retries, rate-limiting & observability (2–3 days)

**Goal:** Make your tools resilient and polite.

**Why:** Avoid accidental DoS, account lockouts, and produce actionable logs.

**What to learn**

- Retry patterns (`tenacity` or `urllib3.Retry`).
- Exponential backoff + jitter.
- Rate limiting with token bucket or `asyncio.Semaphore`.
- Structured logging (JSON) for ingestion.
- Metrics basics: counters, timings (simple logging/metrics endpoints).
- Graceful shutdown (SIGINT/SIGTERM handling).
    

**Deliverables**

- Add retry/backoff to your HTTP and socket calls.
- Implement graceful CTRL-C handling in threaded and async tasks.
    

**Exercises**

1. Wrap a request in `tenacity` with exponential backoff and log each retry.
2. Add `signal` handler to your scanner for clean shutdown.
    

**Libraries**

- `tenacity` (recommended), `signal` (stdlib)
    

---

## Phase 10 — UX, CLIs, autocompletion & pretty output (1–2 days)

**Goal:** Make tools pleasant to use and easy to automate.

**What to learn**

- `typer` / `click` for nicer CLI ergonomics (optional: `argparse` is fine).
- `rich` for pretty tables/progress bars.
- `argcomplete` for shell autocomplete.
    
- Output modes: `--format json|text` and `--quiet` flags.
    

**Deliverables**

- Wrap one tool with `typer` and show a `rich` table of results.
- Enable `argcomplete` and document activation.
    

**Exercises**

1. Replace your `--report` output with `rich` table and `--json` for machine output.
    

**Libraries**

- `rich`, `typer`, `argcomplete`
    

---

## Phase 11 — Testing, CI & packaging (2–3 days)

**Goal:** Tests and reproducible builds.

**What to learn**

- Unit tests for parsers and `build_parser()` functions (pytest).
- Mocking network calls (`requests-mock`, `pytest-mock`).
- Packaging: `requirements.txt`, `pipx` for single-user tools, `setuptools`/`poetry` for packages.
- Basic CI: run tests on push, lint, and run simple smoke tests.
    

**Deliverables**

- `pytest` tests for parser & HTTP util with mocks.
- `requirements.txt` and `Makefile` for common tasks.
    

**Exercises**

1. Test `banner()` with a local dummy server using `socketserver` in a subprocess and assert response handling.
2. Add GitHub Actions skeleton to run pytest on push.
    

---

## Phase 12 — Performance & profiling (1–2 days)

**Goal:** Learn to find bottlenecks.

**What to learn**

- `timeit` and `cProfile` usage.
- Memory profiling (`tracemalloc`).
- When to use `multiprocessing` vs threads vs asyncio.
    

**Deliverables**

- Profile the async fuzzer vs threaded fuzzer for the same workload; document CPU vs I/O bottlenecks.
    

---

## Phase 13 — Advanced & optional (ongoing)

**Goal:** Master specialist tooling as needed.

**Topics**

- `pwntools`, `capstone`, `unicorn` — exploitation/reverse.
- `frida` — runtime instrumentation.
    
- Deep packet inspection and PCAP analysis (`pyshark`).
- Windows-specific automation and Sysinternals tool wrappers.
    

---

# Cross-phase hygiene and rules (always)

- Use `venv` / `pipx`. Keep tools isolated.
- Defaults: `timeout` everywhere; `verify=True` for TLS unless explicitly intercepting (log when you disable).
- Respect scope and rate limits; auth & legal boundaries must be explicit.
- No `pickle.loads` on untrusted data; `yaml.safe_load` only.
- Redact secrets in logs; provide `--dry-run` for dangerous operations.
- Document CLI and examples in `--help` epilog.
    

---

# Suggested calendar (if you study part-time)

- 2–4 weeks: follow phases 1–6 (most practical value) — do the deliverables and exercises.
    
- Weeks 5–8: phases 7–11 and start integrating into a small portfolio repo (tools + tests).
    
- Ongoing: advanced topics as needed for specific targets (AD, reverse, exploit dev).
