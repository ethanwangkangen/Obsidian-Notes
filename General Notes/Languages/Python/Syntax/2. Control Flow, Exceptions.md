# Control Flow

## If / elif / else
```python 
code = 403
if code in (200, 301):
    pass
elif code == 403:
    print("Forbidden")
else:
    print("Other")
```

## Loops
```python
# for
for p in [80, 443, 445]:
    print(p)

# while
n = 3
while n > 0:
    n -= 1

# enumerate / zip
paths = ["admin", "login"]
codes = [200, 403]
for i, (path, code) in enumerate(zip(paths, codes), start=1):
    print(i, path, code)
    
```

# Exceptions
try -> except -> else -> finally

```python
try:
    r = int("ff", 10)
except ValueError as e:
    print("Bad integer:", e)
else:
    print("Parsed OK")
finally:
    print("Always runs") 
```
FINALLY ALWAYS RUNS!
