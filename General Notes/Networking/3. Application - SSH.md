 Secure SHell is a cryptographic network protocol used to securely acccess and manage remote computers over an unsecured network.
 - Client connects to SSH server (default port 22)
 - Server sends its public key to the client. Client checks this key against a known hosts list to avoid MITM attacks
 - Key exchange and Session Key Generation
 - User Authentication
	 - Client authenticates via password, or public/private key pair
- After this, all commands, responses and data encrypted   

# Client
| Command                             | Purpose / Description                                         |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ssh user@hostname`                 | Connect to remote SSH server as user                          |
| `ssh -p PORT user@hostname`         | Connect specifying a custom port (default is 22)              |
| `ssh -i /path/to/key user@hostname` | Use a specific private key file for authentication            |
| `ssh-keygen`                        | Generate SSH key pair (public/private keys)                   |
| `ssh-copy-id user@hostname`         | Copy your public key to remote server for key-based auth      |
| `scp source dest`                   | Securely copy files to/from remote server                     |
| `sftp user@hostname`                | Start SFTP session to transfer files interactively            |
| `ssh-add /path/to/key`              | Add private key to the SSH authentication agent (`ssh-agent`) |
| `ssh-agent`                         | Start an SSH agent to hold private keys in memory             |
| `ssh-keyscan hostname`              | Fetch public SSH host keys from a server (for known\_hosts)   |
- SSH keys located in ~/.ssh/
	- id_rsa: my private RSA key
	- id_rsa.pub: my public key
	- id_ecdsa, id_ecdsa.pub - ECDSA keys (alternative algo)
	- known_hosts: store fingerprints of servers I connect to, to prevent MITM

# Server
| Command/File                                      | Purpose / Description                                |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `sudo systemctl start sshd`                       | Start the SSH server service                         |
| `sudo systemctl stop sshd`                        | Stop the SSH server service                          |
| `sudo systemctl restart sshd`                     | Restart the SSH server                               |
| `sshd`                                            | The SSH daemon executable (usually auto-started)     |
| `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`                            | SSH server configuration file                        |
| `/var/log/auth.log` or `/var/log/secure`          | Log file containing SSH login attempts and errors    |
| `authorized_keys` (in userâ€™s `~/.ssh/` directory) | Contains public keys allowed to log in for that user |
| `ssh-keygen -A`                                   | Generate host keys for the server (RSA, ECDSA, etc.) |
- Host keys
	- /etc/ssh
	- ssh_host_rsa_key (private), ssh_host_rsa_key.pub (public)
	- these identify he server and are used during the handshake
- User keys
	- ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
	- SSH daemon checks this to authenticate users via keys
