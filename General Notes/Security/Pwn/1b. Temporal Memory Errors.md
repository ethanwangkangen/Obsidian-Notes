Lifetime 
- Portion of program execution during which storage is guaranteed
- eg. auto vs static
- (execution of g),....

Scope
- region of code where variable can be accessed
- eg. lobal function-local,..

eg. 
```c
int foo() {
	int *p = NULL:
	{
		int x = 5;
		p = &x;
	}
	return *p;
}
```

What this program return?
- UNDEFINED BEHAVIOUR
- liftime of x is within the inner block {}
- compiler can choose to remove storage for x
- in the last line, the pointed to object (x) is accessed out of scope
	- that region of memory might already have been replaced (say eg. multithreading)


# use after free vulnerability

# double free vulnerability
- write anything anywhere exploit?
- key idea:
	- double free -> two of the same memory locations in the "free list"
	- normally, malloc returns heap location
	- but now, after double free, malloc returns the free list memory itself
		- can modify the chunk, change return pointer to anywhere in memory and write
