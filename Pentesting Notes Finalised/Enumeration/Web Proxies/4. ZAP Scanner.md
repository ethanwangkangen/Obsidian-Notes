| Thing           | What it does                    | How it works                                                                                             | When to use                                                          |

| **Spider**      | Discovers URLs fast             | Parses HTML/links/sitemaps/robots.txt. **Does not execute JavaScript.**                                  | Traditional, mostly static sites; quick first crawl.                 |
| **AJAX Spider** | Discovers URLs in JS-heavy apps | Drives a real browser to execute JS, click buttons, follow XHR/fetch routes. Slower but deeper for SPAs. | Single-page apps, dynamic menus, JS-rendered content.                |
| **Active Scan** | Actively tests for vulns        | Sends payloads to discovered endpoints/params; can be state-changing/destructive.                        | After youâ€™ve crawled (Spider/AJAX Spider) and built a good site map. |

Basically,
- Spider, then AJAX Spider
- Then run Active Scan on site root or context with recursion enabled
	- Or just run on the subdirectories themselves

If find exploit
- View the request
	- Can then move the **request** to menual request editor 
		- Can then modify it.
		- Eg. Found a remote command injection, but the command you want is different
		- Use manual request editor to change the command to the right thing
			- Can right click to encode/decode properly as well.
