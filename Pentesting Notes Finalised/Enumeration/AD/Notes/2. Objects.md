# Objects
## Users
- Leaf objects → hold no child objects.
- Security principals → have **SID + GUID**.
- Store attributes (name, login times, email, manager, etc.).
- Valuable targets: even low-priv users can enumerate the domain.
## Contacts
- Leaf objects.
- **Not** security principals (no SID).
- Used as info cards for external people.
## Printers
- Leaf objects.
- Not security principals.
- Represent a printer inside AD.
## Computers
- Leaf objects.
- Security principals → have a SID.
- Any domain-joined machine (workstation/server).
- SYSTEM on a machine has similar privilege to a normal domain user for enumeration.

## Shared Folders
- Leaf objects.
- Not security principals.
- Represent folder shares with access controls.

## Groups
- Container objects → can hold users, computers, and other groups (nested groups).
- Security principals → have a SID.
- Used to manage permissions efficiently.
- Nested membership can unintentionally create privilege escalation paths (BloodHound finds these).

## Organisational Units (OUs)
- Container objects used to group similar objects for administration.
- _Hierarchical_ — OUs can contain OUs.
- Used to:
    - Delegate admin tasks
    - Apply Group Policy to subsets of objects
    - Organise departments (HR, IT, Finance)

## Domain
- Logical Security boundary
- DC is the brain of AD

## Sites
- Collection of subnets connected by fast links
- Used to optimise replication between DCs

## Build-in
- Default container holding predefined groups created with the domain

## Foreign Security Principals
- Placeholder objects representing users/groups from *external forests* via trust
- Stored in **Foreign Security Principals** container
- Contain only the foreign object's SID
# Diff between Group and OU
**Groups = for permissions**  
**OUs = for organisation + policy application**

# **What is an OU?**
An **Organisational Unit (OU)** is:
- a **container** inside a _domain_
- used to **organise** objects (users, computers)
- used to **apply Group Policies (GPOs)**
- used for **delegating administrative control**
    
🔸 **OUs cannot be given permissions to resources.**  
🔸 **OUs do not appear in ACLs.**

OUs form a **hierarchy** inside one domain.

# What is a Group?

A **Group** is:
- a **collection** of users, computers, or other groups
- used to grant **permissions**
- can appear in **ACLs** (file permissions, folder permissions, RDP access, etc.)

Groups **do not organise objects physically**.  
They **do not apply GPOs** by themselves.
