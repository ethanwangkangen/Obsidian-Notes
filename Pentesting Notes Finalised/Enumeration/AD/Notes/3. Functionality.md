# DC  FSMO Roles

| **Roles**                  | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Schema Master`            | Manages the **read/write copy of the AD schema**, which defines all attributes that can apply to an object in AD.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `Domain Naming Master`     | Manages d**omain names** and ensures that two domains of the same name are not created in the same forest.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `Relative ID (RID) Master` | **Assigns** blocks of **RIDs** to other DCs within the domain that can be used for new objects. Ensures  multiple objects are **not assigned the same SID**. Domain object SIDs are the domain SID combined with the RID number assigned to the object to make the unique SID.                            |
| `PDC Emulator`             | Authoritative DC in the domain and respond to **authentication requests, password changes**, and manage **Group Policy Objects (GPOs)**. Also maintains time within the domain.                                                                                                                           |
| `Infrastructure Master`    | This role translates **GUIDs, SIDs, and DNs between domains.** Used in organizations with multiple domains in a single forest. The Infrastructure Master helps them to communicate. If this role is not functioning properly, Access Control Lists (ACLs) will show SIDs instead of fully resolved names. |

# Trust

| **Trust Type** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                        |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Parent-child` | Domains within the same forest. The child domain has a two-way transitive trust with the parent domain.                                                                |
| `Cross-link`   | a trust between child domains to speed up authentication.                                                                                                              |
| `External`     | A non-transitive trust between two separate domains in separate forests which are not already joined by a forest trust. This type of trust utilizes SID filtering.     |
| `Tree-root`    | a two-way transitive trust between a forest root domain and a new tree root domain. They are created by design when you set up a new tree root domain within a forest. |
| `Forest`       | a transitive trust between two forest root domains.                                                                                                                    |
Transitivity
- Transitive: trust extends to objects that child domain trusts
- Non-transitive: only child domain trusted

Direction
- Birectional: users from both trusting domains can access resources
- One-way: only users in trusted domain can access resources in trusting domain, not vice versa
	- Trust direction opposite to hat of access
