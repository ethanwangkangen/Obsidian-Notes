# Fingerprinting
- Banner grabbing
	- curl the url
- Analysing HTTP headers
	- Server header typically discloses web server software, X-Powered-By header might reveal additional technologies like scripting languages or frameworks
- Probing for specific responses
- Analysing page content

# WafwOOf
 Used to identify Web Application Firewalls (WAFs)
-  `pip3 install git+https://github.com/EnableSecurity/wafw00f
- `wafw00f example.com


# Nikto
Open source web server scanner
- `sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y perl
- `git clone https://github.com/sullo/nikto
- `cd nikto/program
- `chmod +x ./nikto.pl
- `nikto -h inlanefreight.com -Tuning b
	- -h to specify host
	- -Tuning b -> only run Software Identification modules


# Example question
- Target IP given
- vhosts required:
	- app.inlanefreight.local
	- dev.inlanefreight.local
- this means that these both run on the same server (and the same port serves http server), but respond differently depending on host header
- so we need to add entries to /etc/hosts
	- `<IP> app.inlanefreight.local`
- banner grabbing for apache version
	- curl -I IP
