# Web crawling
- Starts with see URL
- Crawler fetches the page, parses content, extracts all links
- Then adds links to queue and crawls them
- Breadth-first vd depth-first crawling
- Information possible gathered
	- links
	- comments
	- metadata
		- eg. page titles, descriptions,...
	- sensitive files,...
		- backup files (eg. .back, .old)
		- config files (web.config, settings.php)
		- log files (error_log, access_log)
- Context is important

***See Scrappy code below***

# robots.txt
- File placed in root directory of website, eg. www.example.com/robots.txt
- Specifies which URLS that crawlers are not allowed to view

# Well-known URIs
- Standardized directory within website's root domain
- Usually accessible via /.well-known/ path on web server
- Allows clients (like browsers, apps, APIs) to automatically discover information or resources without needing to guess or rely on documentation

- **Security / Authentication**
    - `/.well-known/security.txt` → lists how to report security vulnerabilities.
    - `/.well-known/openid-configuration` → metadata for OpenID Connect.
    - `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` → OAuth2 discovery.
- **Web Services**
    - `/.well-known/host-meta` → WebFinger and federated identity lookups.
    - `/.well-known/apple-app-site-association` → iOS universal link configuration.
- **Cryptography**
    - `/.well-known/change-password` → redirects users to a password reset page.
    - `/.well-known/keybase.txt` → proves domain ownership for Keybase.

openid-configuration
- When client wants to use OpenID Connect for authentication, can retrieve the OpenID Connect Provider's configuration by accessing the .../.well-known/open-d-configuration endpoint
	- endpoint returns a json document containing metadata about provider's endpoints, supported authentication methods, token issuance and more

The information obtained from the `openid-configuration` endpoint provides multiple exploration opportunities:

1. `Endpoint Discovery`:
    - `Authorization Endpoint`: Identifying the URL for user authorization requests.
    - `Token Endpoint`: Finding the URL where tokens are issued.
    - `Userinfo Endpoint`: Locating the endpoint that provides user information.
2. `JWKS URI`: The `jwks_uri` reveals the `JSON Web Key Set` (`JWKS`), detailing the cryptographic keys used by the server.
3. `Supported Scopes and Response Types`: Understanding which scopes and response types are supported helps in mapping out the functionality and limitations of the OpenID Connect implementation.
4. `Algorithm Details`: Information about supported signing algorithms can be crucial for understanding the security measures in place.
