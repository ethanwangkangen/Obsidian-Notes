# Shebang
`#!/bin/bash`
- Where is bash located
- If python, would be `#!/usr/bin/env python`

# Arguments
- `$0` - Name of script
- `$1 to $9` -  Arguments

# Variables
- Assigning: NO SPCE
	- eg. `domain=$1`
- Using variables
	- `echo $domain
		- parameter expansion: replace `$domain with the value of the variable `domain
- Command substitution
	- `$(cmd)`
		- run `cmd`, then replace with its stdout (trailing newline trimmed)
	- eg. `netrange=$(whois $ip | grep "NetRange\|CIDR" | tee -a CIDR.txt`
		- Runs the whole pipeline inside the parenthese, replaces it with its stdout.
		- The result is assigned to netrange.
		- Without this, netrange set to whois, then the next command becomes whatever $ip expands to 

$
See $ as an inline replacement operator:
- Need a variable’s text? → $var
- Need another command’s output inline? → $(...)
- Need a quick integer calc inline? → $((...))

# Arrays
```c
domains=(www.inlanefreight.com ftp.inlanefreight.com vpn.inlanefreight.com www2.inlanefreight.com)

echo ${domains[0]}
```

Note: if use " ", then the separation by space will be ignored.

## Special variables

| Variable | Description                                           |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `$#`     | Number of arguments passed to the script.             |
| `$@`     | Used to retrieve the list of command-line arguments.  |
| `$n`     | n'th argument passed to script                        |
| `$$`     | PID of the currently executing process.               |
| `$?`     | Exit status of the script. 0 is success, 1 is failure |

# Conditionals
```c
if [ $# -eq 0]
then 
	echo ...
	echo ...
elif [ ...]
then
	...
fi
```
Note:
- spacing inside `[ ] (after and before the [ ])
- if then ->elif then OR else then -> fi
- can use ; instead of newlines
	- `if [ ... ]; then echo "hi"; fi`

# Comparisons

## Strings

| **Operator** | **Description**                             |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| `==`         | is equal to                                 |
| `!=`         | is not equal to                             |
| `<`          | is less than in ASCII alphabetical order    |
| `>`          | is greater than in ASCII alphabetical order |
| `-z`         | if the string is empty (null)               |
| `-n`         | if the string is not null                   |

Note: when comparing with variables, need put it in double quotes, telling Bash that content of variable should be handled as string
- eg. `if [ "$1" == "Hello" ]`
- More precisely, quotes make it such that it doesn't break if it's empty or has spaces (turns into multiple arguments) or contains globs (`* ?  [ ]`) which can expand to filesnames

eg. `if [[ ! -z "$salt" ]]`
- if $salt variable is not empty

String comparisons (< , >) only work within double square brackets `[[ ]]`

String length:
- `#{$variable}

Searching for string within a string:
- `[[ $haystack == *"$needle"* ]]`
	- * as wildcard

Printing last 20 characters of a tring
- `echo $var | tail -c 20`
	- piping: echo feeds its output to tail, then tail writes it's stdout to terminal.
## Integers

| **Operator** | **Description**             |
| ------------ | --------------------------- |
| `-eq`        | is equal to                 |
| `-ne`        | is not equal to             |
| `-lt`        | is less than                |
| `-le`        | is less than or equal to    |
| `-gt`        | is greater than             |
| `-ge`        | is greater than or equal to |
- be careful not to use things like < here!

## File operators

|**Operator**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`-e`|if the file exist|
|`-f`|tests if it is a file|
|`-d`|tests if it is a directory|
|`-L`|tests if it is if a symbolic link|
|`-N`|checks if the file was modified after it was last read|
|`-O`|if the current user owns the file|
|`-G`|if the file’s group id matches the current user’s|
|`-s`|tests if the file has a size greater than 0|
|`-r`|tests if the file has read permission|
|`-w`|tests if the file has write permission|
|`-x`|tests if the file has execute permission|
eg. `if [ -e "$1" ]`

## Boolean/logical operators
- Can compare strings with `[[ condition ]]`
	- eg. `if [[ $# > 1 ]]`

|**Operator**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`!`|logical negotation NOT|
|`&&`|logical AND|
|`\|`|logical OR|


# Arithmetic

## Arithmetic operations

| **Operator** | **Description**                         |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| `+`          | Addition                                |
| `-`          | Subtraction                             |
| `*`          | Multiplication                          |
| `/`          | Division                                |
| `%`          | Modulus                                 |
| `variable++` | Increase the value of the variable by 1 |
| `variable--` | Decrease the value of the variable by 1 |

`(( ))
- Evaluates a C-style arithmetic evaluation
- Returns exit status 0 (true) if result =/= 0 else 1 if result = 0 (false)
- Use as evaluation/test context
	- eg. `if (( i > 3 )); then echo "bigger'; fi`
		- if i=4, echoes "bigger"
	- eg. `(( i++ ))
		- If i do this without the brackets, bash will parse i++ as a command named i with arguments ++ instead of maths

`$(( ))`
- Essentially an inline calculator
- expansion to a string, use when want the value in output or to asign
- eg. `echo $((10+10))`
- eg. `sum=$((y+x))`

Variable length
- `echo ${#variable_name}

# Flow: Loops
```c
for variable in 1 2 3 4
do
	echo $variable
done
```
- `for variable in file1 file2 file3`
- `for ip in "10.10.10.170 10.10.10.174 10.10.10.175"`
- `for ip in $ipaddr`
	- eg. if $ipaddr outputs multiple arguments
