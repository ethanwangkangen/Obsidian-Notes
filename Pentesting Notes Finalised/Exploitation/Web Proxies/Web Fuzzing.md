# Burp Intruder
- THROTTLED! Limitd to 1 request per second, EXTREMELY slow
- Only use for short queries

- Send request, go proxy history and send to `Intruder`

## Settings
- Payload position
	-  Either wrap it with ยง or by selecting the word DIRECTORY and clicking on the Add ยง button
	- To check if Web directory exists, fuzzing should be in 'GET /DIRECTORY'
		- Existing pages return 200 OK, else 404 NOT FOUND
- Payload type
	- Simple List: The basic and most fundamental type. We provide a wordlist, and Intruder iterates over each line in it.
	- Runtime file: Similar to Simple List, but loads line-by-line as the scan runs to avoid excessive memory usage by Burp.
	- Character Substitution: Lets us specify a list of characters and their replacements, and Burp Intruder tries all potential permutations.
- Payload Config
	- Different for each of the above payload types
		- Simple list: need wordlist
			- `/opt/useful/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt`
			- Or can build own
		- If very large wordlist, best to use RunTime File type
- Payload processing
	- eg. Skip if matches regex
		- KIV: learn regex
- Settings
	- Grep - Match
		- Can flag responses match certain responses
			- eg. 200 OK
