Example
- nmap scan
	- see that system is listening on ports 80, 443 (Http and Https), 3306 (MySql), 21 (FTP)
	- assume it is a web server hosting a web application
	- see some version numbers and LInux distribution
- checkout the website
	- find a network configuration management tool called rConfig
		- see version number
		- check for CVEs, publicly available exploits, proof of concepts (POCs)
- search in msfconsole
	- search rconfig
	- note: there may be useful exploit modules not installed on our system or not showing up via search
		- more detailed search: google search rConfig 3.9.6 exploit metasploit github
- we found
	- rconfig_vendors_auth_file_upload_rce.rb
	- `locate exploits`
	- on Pwnbox, Metasploit exploit modules kept in
		- `/usr/share/metasploit-framework/modules/exploits`
	- copy the file found online
		- make sure it is a `.rb file
		- save it in `/usr/share/metasploit-framework/modules/exploits/linux/http`, similar to what they do in the Github repo
	- keep msf up to date
		- `apt update`
		- `apt install metasploit-framework`
- using the exploit
	- `use exploit/linux/http/rconfig_vendors_auth_file_upload_rce`
- getting a shell
	- `shell`

# Spawning a tty shell with python
- Non-tty shell
	- no prompt present
	- may have limited functionality
		- eg. no sudo?
- Upgrading to TTY shell (options)
	- `/bin/sh -i`
	- `python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/sh")' `
	- `perl â€”e 'exec "/bin/sh";'`
	- `ruby: exec "/bin/sh"
		- run from script
	- `lua: os.execute('/bin/sh')
		- run from script
	- `awk 'BEGIN {system("/bin/sh")}'
	- `find / -name nameoffile -exec /bin/awk 'BEGIN {system("/bin/sh")}' \;`

# Permissions
- Should be mindful of the permissions we have with the shell session's acount
	- `ls -la <path to directory>`
		- to see file properties and permissions our account has over any given file or binary
	- `sudo -l`
		- to see permissions for sudo
