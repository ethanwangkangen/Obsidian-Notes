- Scanners like Burp Pro, ZAP, Nessus have capabilities for detecting XSS
	- Passive scan: reviews client-side code for potential DOM-based vulnerabilities
	- Active scan: sends payloads to attempt to trigger XSS through payload injection in page source

# XSS Strike
- `git clone https://github.com/s0md3v/XSStrike.git`
- `cd XSStrike`
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- `python xsstrike.py`
- `python xsstrike.py -u "http://SERVER_IP:PORT/index.php?task=test" `

# Manual XSS Payload testing
- https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/XSS%20Injection/README.md

Note: XSS can be injected into **any input** in the HTML page, which is not exclusive to HTML input fields, but may also be in **HTTP headers like the Cookie or User-Agent (i.e., when their values are displayed on the page)**.

- Try to find areas where user input is **reflected**
	- eg. in the example form given, nothing reflected after registering, but then **after** a successful registration, can manipulate URL parameters to make it show '.... is not a valid email'.
	- Burp Suite, look at HTML responses.
