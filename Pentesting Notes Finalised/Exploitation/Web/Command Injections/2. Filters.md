# Identifying Filters

## Filter/WAF
- If we see error message in the field where output is displayed, means it was detected and prevented by the PHP **web app** itself
- If error message displayed **different page**, with info like our ip and request, may indicate **WAF**

## Blacklist
eg. in Backend,
```php
$blacklist = ['&', '|', ';', ...SNIP...];
foreach ($blacklist as $character) {
    if (strpos($_POST['ip'], $character) !== false) {
        echo "Invalid input";
    }
}
```
- Should try to identify the blacklisted character

Bypasses
- Remember to encode everything as URL-encoded character!
- Bypassing spaces
	- Using Tabs instead of spaces
		- `%09`
	- Using $IFS
		- `%09`
		- Linux Environment Variable 
-
