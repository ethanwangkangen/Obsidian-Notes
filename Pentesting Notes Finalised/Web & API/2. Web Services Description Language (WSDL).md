- Is an XML-based file exposed by web services
	- Informs clients of provided services/methods, including where they reside, method-calling convention
- Should not always be accessible 

Looking for possibly obscured WSDL file: 
1. Directory/parameter fuzzing
	-  Eg. we have a SOAP service residing in `http://<Target IP>: 3002
	- `dirb http://<TARGET IP>:3002`
2. Try to get the WSDL file
	 - Eg. found path .../wsdl from above,
	- `curl dirb http://<TARGET IP>:3002/wsdl`
3. Parameter fuzzing with ffuf 
	- Eg. found path `http://<Target IP>:3002/wsdl` from above, but empty response when curl
	- `ffuf -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/burp-parameter-names.txt -u 'http://<TARGET IP>:3002/wsdl?FUZZ' -fs 0 -mc 200`


# WSDL file breakdown
- Definition
	- Root element of all WSDL file
	- Specifies: name of web service, all namespaces used across WSDL document declared, all other service elements defined
- Types
	- Data types to be used in the exchanged messages
	- Eg. LoginRequest, LoginResponse..
- Messages
	- Wraps the above **types** as payloads
	- Defines input and output operations that web service supports
	- Messages defines and presented wither as entire document or as **arguments** to be mapped to method invocation
	- Eg. LoginSoapIn message, is a parameter of the LoginRequest method (see above, Datatypes)
- Port Type (In WSDL2.0, this is **interface**, and **operations** are called **endpoints**)
	- List of **operations** (methods) and which **messages** they take/return
	- Eg. Login Operation encapsulates the input message LoginSoapIn and LoginSoapOut (Datatypes)
- Binding
	- A concrete protocol mapping for one **portType**
	- Binds operation to a particular port type
	- How operations (port Type) travel over a protocl (SOAP/HTTP)
	- Client calls the relevant port type, and using details provided by binding, will be able to access the operations bound to this port type
- Service
	- The deploy time address that exposes a **binding**
	- Each port = a binding + network address (URL)
	- Client makes call to web service through name of the service specified inservice tag

TLDR
- types creates data shapes.
- message wraps those shapes.
- portType lists operations using those messages.
- binding says how to send/receive them (SOAP rules).
- service/port gives you the actual URL.
