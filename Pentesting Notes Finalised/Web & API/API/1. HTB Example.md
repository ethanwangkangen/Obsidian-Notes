- API uses Role-based Access Control (RBAC)
- Interact with API using different users with varying roles
	- Credentials associated with `pentestercompany.com` domain represent `supplier` accounts, while those with `hackthebox.com` represent `customer` accounts
- For each authenticated user,
	- Has pre-determined roles
	- For this example, roles tied to what endpoints they have access to
		- eg. with `Suppliers_GetAll` role, can interact with endpoint that retrieves all supplier records (`/api/v1/suppliers)
