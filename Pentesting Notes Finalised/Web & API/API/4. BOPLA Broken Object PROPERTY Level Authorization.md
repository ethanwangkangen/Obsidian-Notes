As the name suggests
- Users have access to the **object**, but possibly should not have for some of its **properties**

2 subclasses
- Excessive Data Exposure
	- **Reveals sensitive data** to authorized users that they are not supposed to access
- Mass Assignment
	- Permits authorized users to **manipulate** sensitive **object properties** beyond their authorized scope

# Excessive Data Exposure
Eg. 
1. Sign in via end point, get JWT
2. See roles: `/api/v1/roles/current-user` -> `Suppliers_Get` and `Suppliers_GetAll`
3. `/api/v1/suppliers GET` -> get `id`, `companyID`, `name` but also **`email` and `phone numbers`**
	- Not supposed to get this

## Prevention:
- Return a specific response **Data Transfer Object (DTO)** that includes **only fields intended for customer visbility** rather than the entire domain model used for database interaction

# Mass Assignment - Improperly Controlled Modification of Dynamically-Determind Object Attributes

1. Sign in via end point, get JWT
2. See roles: `/api/v1/roles/current-user` -> ``SupplierCompanies_Update`` and `SupplierCompanies_Get`
3. `/api/v1/supplier-companies/current-user` -> `isExemptedFromMarketplace = 0`
4. `/api/v1/supplier-companies PATCH` -> requires the `SupplierCompanies_Update` role, states that Supplier must be staff of company, and allows sending value for `isExemptedFromMarketPlaceFEE`
5. Can set it to 1

## Prevention
- Restrict invokers from updating sensitive fields
	- Again, implement dediccated request **DTO** that inludes fields intended for suppliers to modify
